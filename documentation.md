## 1. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)


### ERD Visual Representation


![MoMo SMS Database ERD](./screenshots/erd_diagram.png)






### Entity Relationships Summary


| Entity | Primary Key | Related Entities | Relationship Type |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| users | user_id | transactions (sender/receiver) | One-to-Many |
| users | user_id | system_logs | One-to-Many |
| users | user_id | user_relationships | Many-to-Many |
| transaction_categories | category_id | transactions | One-to-Many |
| transactions | transaction_id | users, categories | Many-to-One |
| user_relationships | relationship_id | users (junction table) | Many-to-Many |
| system_logs | log_id | users | Many-to-One |


### Key Design Features
- **5 Core Entities** as required by assignment
- **Many-to-Many relationship** resolved with user_relationships junction table
- **Proper cardinality** notation (1:1, 1:M, M:N)
- **Clear PK/FK relationships** with referential integrity

## 2. Design Rationale and Justification


### Database Design Philosophy


The MoMo SMS database follows **Third Normal Form (3NF)** principles to eliminate data redundancy while maintaining optimal query performance for transaction processing. The design prioritizes data integrity, security, and scalability for mobile money operations.


### Entity Design Decisions


**Users Table:** Serves as the central entity for all MoMo participants. The design separates internal system identifiers (user_id) from business identifiers (phone_number) to ensure data consistency and support future system integrations.


**Transactions Table:** Implements dual foreign key references to users table (sender_user_id, receiver_user_id) allowing flexible transaction modeling including transfers, deposits, and withdrawals. The reference_number field ensures SMS message correlation and audit trail maintenance.


**Transaction Categories Table:** Separate entity enables dynamic transaction classification without schema modifications. The category_code field supports system integration while category_name provides human-readable descriptions.


**User Relationships Table:** Junction table resolving many-to-many relationships between users. This supports features like favorite contacts, family groups, and business partnerships, enhancing user experience and enabling targeted services.


**System Logs Table:** Comprehensive audit trail for security, compliance, and troubleshooting. Links user actions to system events while supporting anonymous system operations.


### Performance and Security Considerations


The design implements composite indexes on frequently queried columns, enforces referential integrity through foreign key constraints, and uses appropriate data types for financial precision (DECIMAL for monetary values). Security is enhanced through account status management, transaction validation rules, and comprehensive logging.

## 4. Sample Queries with Screenshots


### Query 1: User Transaction Summary
```sql
SELECT
   u.user_id,
   u.full_name,
   u.phone_number,
   u.account_status,
   COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN t.sender_user_id = u.user_id THEN t.transaction_id END) as sent_count,
   COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN t.receiver_user_id = u.user_id THEN t.transaction_id END) as received_count,
   COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN t.sender_user_id = u.user_id THEN t.amount END), 0) as total_sent,
   COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN t.receiver_user_id = u.user_id THEN t.amount END), 0) as total_received
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN transactions t ON (u.user_id = t.sender_user_id OR u.user_id = t.receiver_user_id)
WHERE u.account_status = 'active'
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.full_name, u.phone_number, u.account_status
ORDER BY (total_sent + total_received) DESC;
```

## 5. Security Rules and Constraints


### Primary Key Constraints
All tables implement auto-incrementing primary keys ensuring unique record identification and optimal index performance.


*[Insert Screenshot: Primary key constraints in phpMyAdmin]*


### Foreign Key Constraints
```sql
-- Transaction sender constraint
ALTER TABLE transactions
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_transactions_sender
FOREIGN KEY (sender_user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE;5. AI Usage Policy & Detection

-- Transaction receiver constraint 
ALTER TABLE transactions
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_transactions_receiver
FOREIGN KEY (receiver_user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```


*[Insert Screenshot: Foreign key relationships display]*


**Security Benefit:** Prevents orphaned records and maintains referential integrity.


### Unique Constraints

**Security Benefit:** Prevents duplicate accounts and SMS processing errors.


### Data Validation Rules
```sql
-- Positive amount validation
ALTER TABLE transactions
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_transactions_amount_positive CHECK (amount > 0);


-- Phone number format validation
ALTER TABLE users
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_users_phone_format CHECK (phone_number REGEXP '^250[0-9]{6}$');


-- Self-transaction prevention
ALTER TABLE transactions
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_transactions_no_self_transfer
CHECK (sender_user_id != receiver_user_id OR receiver_user_id IS NULL);
```


*[Insert Screenshot: Check constraints implementation]*


**Security Benefit:** Ensures data quality and prevents invalid transactions.


### Performance and Security Indexes
```sql
-- User transaction lookup optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_user_date ON transactions(sender_user_id, receiver_user_id, transaction_date);


-- Category analysis performance
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_category_status ON transactions(category_id, status);


-- Audit trail optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_system_logs_user_date ON system_logs(user_id, created_at);
```


*[Insert Screenshot: Database indexes display]*


**Security Benefit:** Fast query execution while maintaining audit trail accessibility.


### Account Security Controls
